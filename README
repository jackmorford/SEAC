SEAC - Source Extraction Algorithm for COBRaS
#############################################

Author: Jack Morford

Based on original flux extraction script by Luke Peck

SEAC is intended as an all in one source detection and flux extraction
script for use on astronomical radio images. It has been designed for
use within the AIPS environment and was motivated by the Cygnus OB2 Radio
Survey (COBRaS).

The source detection algorithm uses a Pixel-by-Pixel method, whereby
pixels above a given seed threshold are detected, then their surrounding
pixels are flooded (i.e. tested to see if they are above a given flood
threshold level). This is the floodfill algorithm as described by Hancock
et al. 2012. The entire program is well described in Chapter 3 of the PhD
thesis of Morford, J. 2017.
